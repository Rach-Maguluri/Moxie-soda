A detailed case study, exploring the Legacy and Future of Moxie Soda

## History
During the War of the Rebellion, Lieutenant Macksey and Doctor Thompson, bonded by the hardships of camp and battlefield, formed a lasting friendship. Macksey, a seasoned traveler and observer, returned from his journeys with a tonic beverage made from the juice of a plant used by natives to endure the equatorial sun. He shared this sample with Doctor Thompson in 1884, sparking extended experiments. Mixing flavors and additional ingredients, Thompson created a palatable compound, which he jokingly named "Moxie" in honor of his friend Macksey, thus birthing the pioneer nerve food in 1886.


For over two decades, Doctor Thompson dedicated himself to his work, often laboring for eighteen hours a day without respite. Initially, he intended to market his creation exclusively to physicians for treating nervous ailments, paralysis, and exhaustion. However, recognizing the potential to reach a wider audience, Thompson conceived the idea of packaging the food as a palatable beverage. He aimed to encourage regular consumption to maintain a nourished nervous system, thereby preventing chronic diseases. Word of this groundbreaking discovery quickly spread, primarily through word of mouth rather than formal advertising. Moxie emerged as the pioneer nerve food precisely when it was needed most. Its ability to provide immediate results without adverse effects, akin to stimulants, made it invaluable. Moxie's capacity to fortify the nervous system, akin to a nutritious meal for a starving individual, earned it the reputation as the go-to remedy for depleted nerves. Its enticing flavor and thirst-quenching properties further cemented its status as the world's most beloved temperance beverage.

# Manufacturing
In 1885, a small quantity of Moxie was initially distributed to local druggists in Lowell, with no anticipation of the overwhelming demand it would generate. However, by mid-May, word of its remarkable qualities spread so rapidly that special machinery had to be procured to meet the soaring demand. By July, production capacity had to be doubled, with operations running day and night to keep up. The success of Moxie was immediate and widespread, with orders pouring in from major cities like Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, even before any substantial advertising efforts were undertaken. Minimal advertising efforts in local newspapers in Lowell had already piqued public interest. Subsequent advertising in newspapers and periodicals further fueled Moxie's growth, establishing it as a staple beverage that continued to gain popularity each year.

## FUN FACTS
The Moxie Horsemobile, a modified automobile featuring a large model of a horse for the driver, was a unique advertising tool deployed around 1918. In 2011, a 1935 Rolls-Royce Moxie Horsemobile sold for $55,000 at auction, showcasing its enduring appeal.
Moxie ice cream, available seasonally in limited quantities in Maine, offers a mild flavor compared to the soft drink, providing a unique twist on a classic treat.
Chefs have incorporated Moxie into their culinary creations for its herbaceous, savory-sweet flavor profile. It is often used in reductions as a glaze for meats like lamb and in dishes such as baked beans, adding a distinctive taste to traditional recipes.
The phrase "You've got a Moxie Nerve" echoes through American history, symbolizing the spirit of the times and the boldness associated with Moxie's enduring legacy.
Moxie garnered notable endorsements from prominent figures such as President Calvin Coolidge and Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams, who endorsed it on various media platforms. Additionally, the company ventured into marketing a beverage named "Ted's Root Beer" during the early sixties. Author E. B. White also praised Moxie, highlighting its gentian root content as a pathway to a fulfilling life.

# Evolution
Moxie production is managed by select bottlers across the United States, including Catawissa Bottling Company in Pennsylvania, which has been producing Moxie since 1945. Other bottlers include Polar Beverages in Massachusetts and Orca Beverage in Washington. Over the years, ownership of the Moxie brand has changed hands, with Monarch Beverage Company acquiring it in 1966 and later selling it to Cornucopia Beverages in 2007. Cornucopia rebranded as the Moxie Beverage Company in 2011 and launched promotional efforts through DrinkMoxie.com. Despite a decline in demand, particularly outside of New England and Pennsylvania, the brand remains iconic, culminating in its acquisition by the Coca-Cola Company in 2018.
